     <h1>Welcome to the webpage of Kaiea Rohlehr</h1>
     <p>I am currently a senior at <abbr title="Metropolitan State University">MSU</abbr>
     studying Geospatial Science.  My area of interest is Geography, however, after completing this lab
     I might want to change it to computer science!<sub>1</sub> Every semester, I am introduced to something new and it I realize that
     I don't know where this degree will take but I am truly enjoying the ride.  
    </p>

     <h2>Things I enjoy</h2>
     <p>In my free time a few things I enjoy are, watching my son's soccer games, hiking, riding my bike, and <b>sleeping,</b>
     <i>sleeping is terribly underrated!</i>  I also enjoy traveling and look forward to my next internationl trip.  My son is also 
     eager to travel.  He inherited my wanderlust.</p>
     
     <h3>Goals</h3>
     <p>I have a few months left before the end of the year and I have created some goals for myself.  They are:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>Summit the Manitou Incline for a second time this year</li>
     <li>ride my bicycle or walk distances that are two miles from my house, instead of driving</li>
     <li>read more</li>
      </ul>
     <p>I really enjoyed creating my webpage and I plan to do more with this knowledge!</p>

     <p>1 I was joking about changing my AOI to computer science.  I just wanted to test using this element</p>
