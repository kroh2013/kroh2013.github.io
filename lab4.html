     <h1>Welcome to the webpage of Kaiea Rohlehr.</h1>
     <p>I am currently a senior at <p><abbr title="Metropolitan State University">MSU</abbr>
     studying Geospatial Science.  My area of interest is Geography, however, after completing this lab
     I might want to change it to computer science!<sub>1</sub></p>

     <h2>Things I enjoy</h2>
     <p>In my free time a few things I enjoy are, watching my son's soccer games, hiking, riding my bike, and <b>sleeping</b>--
     <i>sleeping is terribly underrated!</i>

     <h3>Goals</h3>
     <p>I have a few months left and I have created some goals for myself.  The are:</p>
     <ul>Summit the Manitou Incline twice this year</ul>
     <ul>ride my bicycle or walk distances that are two miles from my house, instead of driving</ul>
     <ul>read more</ul>
     <p>I enjoyed creating my webpage and I am starting to get a hang of this programming thing!</p>

     </hr>
     <p>1 I was joking about changing my AOI to computer science.  I just wanted to test using this element</p>
