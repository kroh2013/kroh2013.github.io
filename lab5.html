  <dt>About gold jewelry</dt>
  <dd>Yellow gold jewelery is still the most popular colour,
    The process of alloying—mixing other metals with pure 24 carat
    gold—gives malleable gold more durability,
    but can also be used to change its colour.</dd>

    <dd>White gold is created through alloying pure gold with white metals
      such as palladium or silver. In addition it is usually plated with rhodium
      to create a harder surface with a brighter shine.</dd>

      <h3>Gold and its composition</h3>
      <p>It is important to understand the value and composition of your gold pieces.</p>
